# Portfolio (scaffold)

This is a small, responsive portfolio scaffold with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styling (dark-only theme)
- `script.js` — basic interactions and sample projects

Quick start (open in browser):
- Open `index.html` directly by double-clicking it.

Run a simple local server (recommended) using PowerShell:

```powershell
# from the project folder
python -m http.server 8000; Start-Process "http://localhost:8000"
```

- Replace placeholder text and links with your real content.
- Add real project pages or repo links in `index.html` project cards.
- Add images into an `assets/` folder and reference them from `index.html`.
 - Replace placeholder text and links with your real content.
 - Add real project pages or repo links in `index.html` project cards.
 - Replace the placeholder email `your.email@example.com` in `index.html` with your real email address.
 - Add images into an `assets/` folder and reference them from `index.html`.

Note: Update the contact placeholders in `index.html`:
- replace `your.email@example.com` with your email address
- replace `your_x_handle` with your X handle (link: `https://x.com/your_x_handle`)
 - Replace placeholder text and links with your real content.
 - Add real project pages or repo links in `index.html` project cards.
 - Replace the placeholder email `your.email@example.com` in `index.html` with your real email address.
 - Add images into an `assets/` folder and reference them from `index.html`.

Recent change: the projects grid now lists only the "LNMIIT Exchange" project in `index.html`. Update the project link and description as needed.

Images: The LNMIIT Exchange card now references `assets/LNMIIT-VIEW.jpg`.
- The uploaded image is saved as `assets/LNMIIT-VIEW.jpg`.

If you want, I can:
- Add a projects detail page template
- Integrate a contact backend (Netlify Functions / Formspree)
- Deploy to GitHub Pages and create a `gh-pages` branch

Note: This site is dark-only. The theme toggle was removed to keep the design simple.
